# ML_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This is a fraud detection project that uses Machine and Deep learning algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and Multi Layer Perceptron along with EDA.

Credit card fraud
detection, which is a data mining problem, becomes
challenging due to two major reasons â€“ first, the profiles of
normal and fraudulent behaviours change constantly and
secondly, credit card fraud data sets are highly
skewed. The performance of fraud detection in credit card
transactions is greatly affected by the sampling approach
on dataset, selection of variables and detection
technique(s) used. This paper investigates the performance
of k-nearest neighbor and logistic regression on highly
skewed credit card fraud data. Dataset of credit card
transactions is sourced from European cardholders
containing 284,807 transactions. A hybrid
technique of under-sampling and oversampling is carried
out on the skewed data. These techniques are applied on
the raw and preprocessed data. The work is implemented
in Python. The performance of the techniques is evaluated
based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision,
Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced
classification rate. The results shows of optimal
accuracy for k-nearest neighbor and logistic
regression classifiers are 97.92%, 97.69% and 54.86%
respectively. The comparative results show that k-nearest
neighbour performs better than logistic
regression techniques.
